for a defiled world,
phantasmal beauty shining
for a wounded heart,
songs of anger resound


Isiliel is the solo project for Himari Tsukishiro (NECRONOMIDOL).

Mixing genres as diverse as folk, blackgaze and city pop via a worldwide team of veteran songwriters such as King Dude and NARASAKI of COALTAR OF THE DEEPERS, through Isiliel Himari will express hitherto unexplored depths of pathos and beauty on stage.
