Luluko (she/they) is a cosplayer specializing in craftsmanship, performance, and putting way too much effort into self-indulgent joke costumes. She is relatively new to Seattle and is honored to be guesting and judging at a PNW convention for the first time! Luluâ€™s favorite idol is Makoto Kikuchi and she would like to take this opportunity to ask everyone reading this to please read _Golden Kamuy_.
