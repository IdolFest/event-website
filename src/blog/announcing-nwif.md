## Announcing NW IdolFest!

Northwest IdolFest is the Seattle area’s premiere, in-person, idol focused event, attracting unique and diverse fans from across the country to the region. Join us for a weekend of fun for fans, by fans—featuring idols, anisong, and everything in between.

Our first festival will be held on November 13-14, 2021, at the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Seattle Airport. Don’t miss a moment of the action and join our official room block by referencing the group name "NW IdolFest" when booking your stay.
During the weekend, content creator and You Wantanabe fan, RinTaichou (formerly known as RinSenpai) will be joining Northwest IdolFest to share their gacha expertise. They’ve been a fan of Love Live! since 2015 and produce videos focusing on the gacha elements of various games. While Love Live! is one of the most popular franchises RinTaichou has featured, they’ve also covered Genshin Impact and other series on their journey to 100k subscribers.

Our staff will also be working hard to bring you panels, artists, music, and more—all exclusively dedicated to idol and anisong fandoms!

Be sure to register by September 12 to secure early bird pricing. Northwest IdolFest offers a variety of brightly colored plastic and stickers for those who are looking to simulate a real life gacha experience of trading money for swag. Will you pull Silver, Gold, or maybe even Prism?

We look forward to shining together as we share our love of idols with Seattle and the world!
