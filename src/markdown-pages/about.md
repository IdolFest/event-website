U.S. IdolFes is a passion project founded by experienced event organizers. Our goal is to create an event space where idol fans of all types can gather and share in the unique joy that idols bring to our lives. Whether youâ€™re a long-time wota or just getting into the scene, USIF has a place for you!

Though our beginnings may be humble, our love for idols knows no bounds. With your help and under the guidance of our dedicated team, we hope to grow into an event that can bring you live guests from overseas. We aim to become the premiere US convention for the idol community!

## The Chair

**Eliana Summers** (*she/her*) started out as an anime nerd. After going through an unfortunate 'anime isn't cool' edgy phase, the idol fandom brought her right back! In her ordinary life, she works on project execution for a major firm. In her geek life, she has staffed over 10 conventions across dozens of events, mostly in the My Little Pony fandom. This is her third event as a chair, and the second one she has founded. In her spare time, she enjoys sleeping.

## The Co-Chair

**Thomas Houghton** (*any, he/him default*) is a professional musician with 17 years of experience and has years of project management and event organizing experience. While doing office coordination by day, he performs in his local music scene, produces music, and organizes amazing events for people to enjoy for audiences in the thousands to tens of thousands. He has also worked as interim HR department head for the IdolFest Foundation as well as the department head for the Events team. He's super excited to support a wonderful idol experience in sunny Los Angeles, California! In his spare time, Thomas enjoys playing visual novels and watching his friends play video games.

## The Staff

Our all-volunteer staff is made up of veteran convention runners from all backgrounds and professions. We operate under a policy of transparency and long-term planning to bring the best possible experience to the United States.
