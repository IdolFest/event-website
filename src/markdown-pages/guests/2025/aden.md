**ADEN** *(they/them)* is an American J-Pop soloist based in the greater Washington, DC area. Inspired by the alternative, underground idol scene in Japan, they aim to showcase darker themes in their original music and covers, along with the beauty and power that comes with having a little edge. When they are not on stage, they are promoting Japanese idol culture by working behind the scenes of various idol events across the East Coast, USA. They will be releasing their second album, CHROMESTHESIA, inspired by their sound-to-color synesthesia, this September!
