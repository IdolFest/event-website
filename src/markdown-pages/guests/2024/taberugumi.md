Taberu Gumi is an Australian born solo idol pursuing her dream in Tokyo Japan. Starting her idol career in 2018, she debuted as a member of a local idol group in Sydney, becoming the leader of the group. She supported the members until the group disbanded in 2020.

Despite the struggles of COVID Gumi travelled to Japan to continue her idol career as a self-produced solo act. 



After 3 years of being being a solo idol, Gumi dreams to expand her activities worldwide by singing and dancing internationally and spreading her love towards Japanese idol culture!



Being a self-produced solo idol, Gumi makes her own costumes, choreography, lyrics, illustrations, designs and translations. She also streams from time to time using her bilingual background to communicate with her worldwide fans!



Gumi is very excited to meet everyone and to share her music and experiences! Make sure to wave your penlight green during her live performance!
