Aniwaza is a North American based dance team specializing in wotagei and are practitioners of cyalume dance.







Our goal as Aniwaza is to promote and spread the culture of wotagei and cyalume dance across the western hemisphere. Currently in North America, there are existing practitioners spread across the country â€“ Aniwaza aims to be the formative, singular collective that can act as the unifying vanguard for the world of wotagei in the West, supplementing existing groups based in Japan and other countries across Southeast Asia such as GinyuforcE.



Aniwaza hosts panels and holds wotagei showcases at anime conventions and other events in the U.S. and North America for this purpose, as well as provides English content on social media for learning about wotagei and cyalume dance.
