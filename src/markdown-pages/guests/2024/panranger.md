Pan Ranger is soloist idol and indie tokusatsu project.

This project combines the aesthetic style of tokusatsu from the 1970s-1990's and the stage performance style of idols.

Since starting this project, Pan has been involved with the international idol community through being an admin for the International Idol Network and Tri-State Idol Union.
