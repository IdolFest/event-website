SHIHORI is an international J-pop singer/songwriter based in LA who composes and performs solo work, as well as music for film, TV, anime, and games. 



She’s best known for "Holy Steel," the fan theme song for "Jojo 's Bizarre Adventure" Part 7 has received a total of over 11M views on YouTube. She has written and composed over 130 songs for J-pop artists such as Nana Mizuki and Momoiro Clover Z, and for such famed shows as Fairy Tail, My Little Pony, Ultraman R/B, Tomodachi Game, Macross Frontier and The Irregular at Magic High School besides her original works.



After many of her releases have made the Oricon Chart in Japan with 13 of her hits having attained Gold Disc Certification, in 2018 she moved to the U.S. where she’s performed extensively and has enjoyed international success performing lead vocals on the charity single “The Real Folk Blues” (#6 on the Billboard World Digital Chart). She also composed and performed the theme song for the popular games League of Legends, Omega Strikers and Mobile Legends: Bang Bang.



Born deaf in one ear (but with perfect pitch in the other) and with Asperger Syndrome, she serves as both an inspiration and ambassador for people struggling with disabilities. Her main mission through her music and life is, “to spread love” since it’s her belief all problems and solutions in life connect to this core value.
