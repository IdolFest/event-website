The Dystopian-pop idol with a vendetta, PAiDA is here to force Earthlings onto their knees. PAiDA, from Space City TX, is a fever dream of an artist that has performed across America, Japan and beyoooond~ Her music hides touchy subjects under a veil of chaos, mixing her love of Jpop with her roots as a black singer. Abducting over 200k humans and counting, she is gradually spreading her otherworldly signal across the globe.
