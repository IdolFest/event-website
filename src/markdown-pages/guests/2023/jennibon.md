Made up of sugar (twice!) and everything nice, Jenni Bon will make your heart smile as you fall in love with her sweet magic. While her true love is performing, itâ€™s her dream to help create even more spaces for idols and fans alike to share in idol culture together! 

Jenni has helped create and produce idol events at conventions across the country, and also is the head of the Idolspace programming track at Otakon. She also has something special in store for the attendees of Northwest IdolFest this year -- more info soon!
