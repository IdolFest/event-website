## AT-CON NOTICE: NWIF Harassment Hotline

Please see our anti-harassment policy below. If you feel that you have been harassed and/or feel unsafe because of any person, please call our harassment hotline at (206) 333-9167.

## Welcome!

Welcome to Northwest IdolFest, or NWIF! We are a group of passionate idol fans working to bring idol culture and programming to the US. The primary purpose of NWIF is for the attendees to have fun. To make this happen, NWIF has established certain rules of conduct. These rules were created to ensure the behavior of any one individual or group of attendees does not disturb the enjoyment of another attendee, nor detract from the relaxed and comfortable atmosphere of the event. To both enjoy the convention to the fullest as well as to ensure the safety of all participants, please comply with staff instructions at all times.

NWIF welcomes everyone; however, the event's management reserves the right to deny or revoke the attendance of any individual, at any time, for any reason. This action may be undertaken when an individual's presence or behavior causes significant interference with event operations or adversely affects the organization's relationship with its guests or with its venue. NWIF also reserves the right to amend these rules at any time without prior or posted notice. If you have any questions, please [contact the event staff](/contact) for assistance.

Anyone who accepts a NWIF badge agrees to indemnify and hold harmless NWIF and The IdolFest Foundation from any claim for personal injuries or other damages or equity arising out of any individual's activities at NWIF, even if such injury or damage is caused by negligence by or on the part of NWIF.

## COVID-19

Masking is not required at NWIF 2024 but is highly encouraged due to the size of the venue and the intimate nature of our event. Similarly, we highly encourage that you have received the initial COVID-19 vaccination series and all applicable booster vaccines, but this is also not required. NWIF staff will not be conducting vaccination checks.

On a case-by-case basis, our guests may request for meet and greets that attendees wear a mask. In this event, signage will be clearly posted and staff will alert all attendees without masks or wearing their masks improperly to ensure they are wearing a mask securely over their nose and mouth. 

These policies may change without notice, including during the event. NWIF will always seek to meet and exceed minimum compliance with health regulations, as the health and safety of all attendees and staff are our #1 priorities. Attendees are required to comply with all COVID-19 preventative measures. Failure to comply with any of these measures may result in consequences ranging from removal from the required masking area to confiscation of the attendee's badge and removal from the event depending on severity.

## Anti-Harassment

If someone's behavior makes you feel unwelcome, unsafe, or uncomfortable, that is harassment. NWIF does not allow harassment of any kind, including but not limited to behaviors such as: stalking, offensive comments, hate speech, bathroom policing, inappropriate or unwelcome physical contact, recording or taking pictures without permission, and repeatedly disrupting conversations you have been asked to leave. The aforementioned comments or hate speech could be in relation to: age, race or ethnicity, color, citizenship or national origin, relationship status, sexual orientation, gender identity or presentation, appearance, clothing, body size, pregnancy, disability, or religion. This list is not an exhaustive list.

Keep your hands to yourself. Respect your fellow attendees. Keep an eye on what you say to people and how you act around them. Take notice of people's pronouns and use them. Remember, cosplay is not consent: just because someone is in costume, it doesn't give you permission to take a picture or touch their costume. Ask first, and if they tell you no, respect that.

If you feel harassed or see someone else being harassed, notify a staff member immediately. You are also within your rights to ask the harasser to stop on your own. Once notified, NWIF staff will take any action necessary to stop the behavior, up to and including badge revocation and expulsion from convention premises. We will also take steps to help you feel safe again at your request, such as escorting you to a place you feel safe, contacting your friends or family for you, or contacting local law enforcement.

This policy applies without exception to everyone at the convention, including attendees, panelists, vendors, guests, convention staff, and venue staff.

## Minor Attendees

All attendees who are under 18 during any time they are at Northwest IdolFest are required to provide a consent form signed by a legal guardian. The consent form can be downloaded [here](/Parental%20Consent%20Form.pdf). If the legal guardian will be present at the event with the minor, then the form can be signed in front of us. If the legal guardian will not be in attendance, the form may be brought pre-signed.

Minors ages 13-17 may attend Northwest IdolFest without accompaniment, so long as they have a completed consent form. Minors 12 years of age and under must be accompanied at all times by an adult with a paid badge.

School IDs are accepted as proof of ID, or, if accompanied by an adult, the adult's ID may be accepted instead.

## Content Rating

All content at NWIF is expected to fall within a PG-13 rating unless otherwise approved by event chairs. Any content deemed inappropriate will be asked to be removed from the convention space. This includes any imagery or discussion of drugs, alcohol, sex, or violence. If you are unsure if your content complies with our policies, please ask a staff member!

## Events (Programming)

All attendees and staff providing content including, but not limited to panels and performances at Northwest IdolFest (referred to in this section as “presenters”) are expected to abide by the content rating as well as providing content that aligns with the scope and mission of our event. To ensure this process is followed through, we maintain an application process for all presenters of which its opening and closing are announced on social media and hosted on our website. Content presented at NWIF is hand-selected by members of our staff to ensure that the content aligns with our standards and follows all expectations for NWIF content.

NWIF staff are permitted to apply to provide content unless otherwise directed by a NWIF Department Head. Staff are held to the same standards listed above for all other attendees and must complete the same application. Any NWIF staff involved in the process of reviewing applications are not permitted to participate in the review of their own application and are advised to not participate in the review process altogether.

Once scheduled to provide content, presenters are expected to provide content at that time. Presenters may request a change to their scheduled time and/or to cancel/withdraw their offering of content at any time up to one (1) week prior to the first day of the event by emailing events@nwidolfest.com and requesting the change. After this time, no change requests other than cancellations/withdrawals will be honored. If canceling/withdrawing, any compensation provided by the event to the ex-presenter will be revoked.

All changes are subject to the approval of the Department Head for the Events team. The Events Department Head reserves the right to adjust or deny any requests submitted to align with the needs of the event. 

Presenters are expected to arrive at their scheduled room for content presentation 15-30 minutes prior to their scheduled start time. This requirement may be superseded by direction from NWIF staff, and the most recent guidance should be followed by presenters. Presenters are expected to present their content and not go over the time allotted to them. In severe cases, NWIF staff may directly request for the presenter to wrap up their content so that the lineup of content for their room can continue on time.

## Badges

Badges must be visibly displayed on your person while in event space. In case of lost badge, one $20 replacement will be available with presentation of photo ID. Additional replacements will be charged full price.

Badges are not refundable, but may be transferred to another person at any point before the convention. To request a transfer, email [registration@nwidolfest.com](mailto:registration@nwidolfest.com).

## Lost Items

In the case of lost items, please reach out to hotel staff or call the front desk. NWIF does not operate a Lost & Found and is not responsible for any personal belongings that may be lost, damaged, or stolen during the event.

## Hotel & State Rules

You must comply with hotel and government rules while on hotel premises. What’s illegal outside the hotel is illegal inside the hotel. Please follow any instructions given to you by members of hotel staff. If you have concerns, contact any NWIF staff member.

Do not stick anything to hotel walls. Any unapproved material on hotel walls will be removed, and any damage caused will be the responsibility of the poster. Flyer distributions are allowed as long as they comply with a PG-13 content rating.

## Cosplay

We’re excited to see cosplayers sharing their love of anime and idols! Keep the following rules in mind when designing your costume or cosplay, and please see the following section on Weapons for more information.

* Our coverage policy is gender-neutral. All clothing or costumes must cover the complete groin, buttocks, and breasts.
* All clothing worn in convention space must be appropriate for our PG-13 rating. This includes text on costumes or accessories attached to costumes.
* Clothing printed with pornographic imagery, including any ahegao clothing, is not permitted.
* Footwear is required at all times. Socks are not footwear. If you are cosplaying a character that’s barefoot, check out this tutorial on how to make [“invisible shoes”](https://www.andsewingishalfthebattle.com/invisible-shoes/).
* Costumes worn in the event space can not be so large that they obstruct or impede the flow of traffic or entryways for all attendee’s safety. If the costume cannot fit through a standard doorway, you may be asked to store it. Exceptions may be made for Masquerade contestants.
* Attendees with bulky costumes, costumes that obscure vision, or costumes with large extensions such as wings or spikes, should have a designated “handler,” to assist them through the hallways and crowds.
* Functioning wheels cannot be used as part of a costume or prop (i.e. anything that you might ride, push, or pull). Costumes made with wheelchairs in mind are an exception as long as they do not impede traffic flow.
* No costumes may depict law enforcement, military uniforms, first responders, emergency medical personnel, or any official government agent.
* Costumes may not target or harass any specific person, culture, nationality, or anything else that may come off as rude or inappropriate. Our anti-harassment policy applies at all times.

## Weapons

**Live Steel**

Live steel props are any props crafted from metal with a pointed end or blade-like edge, whether blunt or sharp. All such objects are strictly prohibited in convention spaces. This rule does not apply to objects with only the appearance of metal, such as wooden swords wrapped in aluminum foil.

**Weapons**

Projectile weapons such as bows, slings, or crossbows must be disabled and unloaded. Bows must be unstrung or strung with a flimsy and loose material such as twine. No bolts or arrows may be carried as part of a costume unless they are fake, not fireable, and not sharp or dangerous.

**Gun-like Props**

All props that can reasonably be perceived to be a real firearm due to their color, size, shape, or other characteristics are prohibited from the convention. Gun-like props that do not fall under this restriction must have an orange tip as part of the prop at the point of manufacture. (That is, using orange tape or paint on the tip does not qualify unless you made the prop yourself, e.g. out of Styrofoam.) Furthermore, no airsoft guns of any kind are allowed in convention space, disabled or otherwise, and no ammunition of any kind may be carried. Toy guns (such as NERF guns) must be unloaded and their magazines, if present, must be removed except during photos. In all cases, take care to avoid gun-like props with color schemes commonly found on real firearms such as black, gunmetal gray, or tan.

**Guns**

Real firearms, even if disabled or unloaded, are strictly prohibited in all convention spaces. If you are an off-duty law enforcement officer, carrying your sidearm through convention space is at the discretion of the Head of Security. Please come see the Head of Security when you enter the con so there are no unfortunate misunderstandings.

## Accessibility

NWIF is committed to making our event accessible to all. Our approach to some accessibility needs are detailed below, but this is not a complete list. If you have further accessibility needs, please [contact us](/contact)! 

Our host hotel, the DoubleTree, complies with ADA guidelines in most spaces. Their website has a full list of [accessible amenities](https://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/washington/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-seattle-airport-CTAC-DT/about/amenities.html).

Our event space for 2024 is on the first and second floors of the DoubleTree. There is a wheelchair-friendly elevator route to the second floor, to the right of our registration tables. A convention staff member or hotel staff member will be able to direct you. All rooms can be accessed without steps

If you are unable to stand in line for a panel, please contact a member of our Safety team. They can assist you with either a chair to wait to the side of the line, or an early seat at the panel.

In accordance with the ADA, service animals are permitted in hotel and event space. Non-service animals may be permitted in hotel common areas and rooms but are not permitted in NWIF event space. Please contact the hotel directly for any questions relating to their pet policy.

The Northern Lights Concert will use strobe lights. A warning sign will be posted on the door of the Main Auditorium during the concert indicating that flashing lights may be in use. If you are photosensitive and would like to attend the concert, please let us know ahead of time so we can review the lighting plan with you.

## Photos & Videos

NWIF attendees should be aware that audio and/or video recordings are frequently made in convention areas and that their likenesses may appear in those recordings. Individual members agree to assign without compensation the use of their likeness(es) at NWIF for the use of promotional material such as highlights and videos.

Everyone must comply with the NWIF anti-harassment policy when taking photos or videos of others. Be respectful and remember cosplay is not consent.

NWIF has staff photographers, who may take audio/video recordings during times when attendees are not permitted to record.

If you are taking photos for personal use, we request that you give staff photographers priority and move out of their shot if asked. Thank you!
