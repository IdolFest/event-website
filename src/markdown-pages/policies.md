## Welcome!

Welcome to Northwest IdolFest (NWIF)! We are a group of passionate idol fans working to bring idol culture and programming to the US. The primary purpose of NWIF is for the attendees to have fun. To make this happen, NWIF has established certain rules of conduct. These rules were created to ensure the behavior of any one individual or group of attendees does not disturb the enjoyment of another attendee, nor detract from the relaxed and comfortable atmosphere of the event. To both enjoy the convention to the fullest as well as to ensure the safety of all participants, please comply with staff instructions at all times.

NWIF welcomes everyone; however, the event's management reserves the right to deny or revoke the attendance of any individual, at any time, for any reason. This action may be undertaken when an individual's presence or behavior causes significant interference with event operations or adversely affects the organization's relationship with its guests or with its venue. NWIF also reserves the right to amend these rules at any time without prior or posted notice. If you have any questions, please [contact the event staff](/contact) for assistance.

Anyone who accepts a NWIF badge agrees to indemnify and hold harmless NWIF and Nijiiro Events LLC from any claim for personal injuries or other damages or equity arising out of any individual's activities at NWIF, even if such injury or damage is caused by negligence by or on the part of NWIF.

## COVID-19

NWIF will determine a final COVID-19 policy no later than September 1st, 2022 (pending changes to government regulations after that date).

In 2021, NWIF required proof of COVID-19 vaccination for all attendees over 18. It is likely this will be required again for 2022, with the final dose of the primary series OR a booster administered within 6 months prior to the event. However, we understand things can change significantly in a short period of time, and are waiting to make a final determination until closer to the event.

If you have a medical condition that does not allow you to be vaccinated, please [email us](mailto:chairs@nwidolfest.com) about potential accommodations. If you are under 18, please review the Minor Attendees section below for additional details that may apply.

These policies may change without notice, including during the event. NWIF will always seek to exceed minimum compliance with health regulations, as the health and safety of all attendees and staff are our #1 priority. Attendees are required to comply with all COVID-19 preventative measures.

## Anti-Harassment

If someone's behavior makes you feel unwelcome, unsafe, or uncomfortable, that is harassment. NWIF does not allow harassment of any kind, including but not limited to behaviors such as: stalking, offensive comments, hate speech, bathroom policing, inappropriate or unwelcome physical contact, recording or taking pictures without permission, and repeatedly disrupting conversations you have been asked to leave. The aforementioned comments or hate speech could be in relation to: age, race or ethnicity, color, citizenship or national origin, relationship status, sexual orientation, gender identity or presentation, appearance, clothing, body size, pregnancy, disability, or religion. This list is not an exhaustive list.

Keep your hands to yourself. Respect your fellow attendees. Keep an eye on what you say to people and how you act around them. Take notice of people's pronouns and use them. Remember, cosplay is not consent: just because someone is in costume, it doesn't give you permission to take a picture or touch their costume. Ask first, and if they tell you no, respect that.

If you feel harassed or see someone else being harassed, notify a staff member immediately. You are also within your rights to ask the harasser to stop on your own. Once notified, NWIF staff will take any action necessary to stop the behavior, up to and including badge revocation and expulsion from convention premises. We will also take steps to help you feel safe again at your request, such as escorting you to a place you feel safe, contacting your friends or family for you, or contacting local law enforcement.

This policy applies without exception to everyone at the convention, including attendees, panelists, vendors, guests, convention staff, and venue staff.

## Minor Attendees

All attendees who are under 18 during any time they are at NW IdolFest are required to provide a consent form signed by a legal guardian. The consent form can be downloaded [here](/Parental%20Consent%20Form.pdf). If the legal guardian will be present at the event with the minor, then the form can be signed in front of us. If the legal guardian will not be in attendance, the form may be brought pre-signed.

Minors ages 13-17 may attend NW IdolFest without accompaniment, so long as they have a completed consent form. Minors 12 years of age and under will need to be accompanied at all times by an adult with a paid badge.

School IDs are accepted as proof of ID, or, if accompanied by an adult, the adult's ID may be accepted instead.

Last year, to comply with our COVID-19 policy, minors were permitted to present either proof of vaccination or a negative test administered within 72 hours by an authorized medical professional. We will post a final determination on the COVID-19 policy for attendees under 18 no later than September 1st, 2022.

## Content Rating

All content at NWIF is expected to fall within a PG-13 rating unless otherwise approved by event chairs. Any content deemed inappropriate will be asked to be removed from the convention space. This includes any imagery or discussion of drugs, alcohol, sex, or violence. If you are unsure if your content complies with our policies, please ask a staff member!

## Badges

Badges must be visibly displayed on your person while in event space. In case of lost badge, one $20 replacement will be available with presentation of photo ID. Additional replacements will be charged full price.

If you are unable to attend due to border closures or other government restrictions, you may request a refund for your badge. Refunds are offered on a case-by-case basis, and documentation may be requested confirming your situation. To request a refund, email [registration@nwidolfest.com](mailto:registration@nwidolfest.com) no later than October 20th, 2022. Refund requests made after this date will not be considered. Refunds are offered at the sole discretion of Nijiiro Events LLC.

## Lost Items

In the case of lost items, please reach out to hotel staff or call the front desk. NWIF does not operate a Lost & Found and is not responsible for any personal belongings that may be lost, damaged, or stolen during the event.

## Hotel & State Rules

You must comply with hotel and government rules while on hotel premises. What’s illegal outside the hotel is illegal inside the hotel. Please follow any instructions given to you by members of hotel staff. If you have concerns, contact any NWIF staff member.

Do not stick anything to hotel walls. Any unapproved material on hotel walls will be removed, and any damage caused will be the responsibility of the poster. Flyer distributions are allowed as long as they comply with a PG-13 content rating.

## Cosplay

We’re excited to see cosplayers sharing their love of anime and idols! Keep the following rules in mind when designing your costume or cosplay:

*   Footwear is required at all times. Socks are not footwear. If you are cosplaying a character that’s barefoot, check out this tutorial on how to make [“invisible shoes”](https://www.andsewingishalfthebattle.com/invisible-shoes/).
*   Costumes and regular clothing should not expose the body in a way that would be deemed as indecent exposure. Private parts must be covered in an opaque material that will not slip or have gaps.
*   Costumes worn in the event space can not be so large that they obstruct or impede the flow of traffic or entryways for all attendee’s safety. If the costume cannot fit through a standard doorway, you may be asked to store it. Exceptions may be made for Masquerade contestants.
*   Attendees with bulky costumes, costumes that obscure vision, or costumes with large extensions such as wings or spikes, should have a designated “handler,” to assist them through the hallways and crowds.
*   Functioning wheels cannot be used as part of a costume or prop (i.e. anything that you might ride, push, or pull). Costumes made with wheelchairs in mind are an exception as long as they do not impede traffic flow.
*   No costumes may be realistic depictions of American law enforcement, current American military uniforms, first responders, emergency medical personnel, or any official government agent.
*   Costumes may not target or harass any specific person, culture, nationality, or anything else that may come off as rude or inappropriate. Our anti-harassment policy applies at all times.

## Accessibility

NWIF is committed to making our event accessible to all. Our approach to some accessibility needs are detailed below, but this is not a complete list. If you have further accessibility needs, please [contact us](/contact)! 

Our host hotel, the DoubleTree, complies with ADA guidelines in most spaces. Their website has a full list of [accessible amenities](https://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/washington/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-seattle-airport-CTAC-DT/about/amenities.html).

Our event space for 2022 is on the first and second floors of the DoubleTree. There is a wheelchair-friendly elevator route to the second floor. All rooms can be accessed without steps. 

For 2022, we do not anticipate having lines for any panels. All panels will be open seating.

In accordance with the ADA, service animals are permitted in hotel and event space. Non-service animals may be permitted in hotel common areas and rooms but are not permitted in NWIF event space. Please contact the hotel directly for any questions relating to their pet policy.

If you are d/Deaf or hard of hearing, we are happy to provide accommodations such as ASL interpretation or live captioning to make our content accessible to you. Please request these services with a minimum of one month’s notice.

The Northern Lights Concert will use strobe lights. A warning sign will be posted on the door of the Main Auditorium during the concert indicating that flashing lights may be in use. If you are photosensitive and would like to attend the concert, please let us know ahead of time so we can review the lighting plan with you.

## Photos & Videos

NWIF attendees should be aware that audio and/or video recordings are frequently made in convention areas and that their likenesses may appear in those recordings. Individual members agree to assign without compensation the use of their likeness(es) at NWIF for the use of promotional material such as highlights and videos.

Attendees must comply with the NWIF anti-harassment policy when taking photos or videos of other attendees. Be respectful and remember cosplay is not consent. Photos and videos of panel content are not allowed unless approved by both the panelists and NWIF staff. You may ask any staff member if a panel allows photos or videos.
