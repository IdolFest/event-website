Northwest IdolFest is a passion project founded by experienced event organizers. Our goal is to create an event space where idol fans of all types can gather and share in the unique joy that idols bring to our lives. Whether youâ€™re a long-time wota or just getting into the scene, NWIF has a place for you!

Our staff application opens in the months before the event, then is typically closed for a little while directly after while we look at the past year and how we want to adjust.

The staff application is currently closed. Please keep an eye on our social media for when applications reopen for our post-move event in 2025!
