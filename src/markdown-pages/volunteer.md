Northwest IdolFest is a passion project founded by experienced event organizers. Our goal is to create an event space where idol fans of all types can gather and share in the unique joy that idols bring to our lives. Whether youâ€™re a long-time wota or just getting into the scene, NWIF has a place for you!

Our staff application opens in the months before the event, then is typically closed for a little while directly after while we look at the past year and how we want to adjust.

The following positions are currently open:

* Artist (for 2025)
* Graphic Design (for 2025)
* Logistics

  * Willingness to drive large vehicles preferred!
* Web Designer
* A/V Techs

  * Prior experience in A/V preferred, willingness to adapt and learn on the fly a must

If you do not see a position here you qualify for but are still interested in being part of the team, please still apply! You can select "Any Available Position" on the application.

The staff application can be found [here](http://idolfe.st/staffapp)[](http://idolfe.st/staffapp). Applications are reviewed intermittently depending on need and on a first-come, first-served basis. One of the members of our team will reach out to you if we wish to move forward with you as a potential staffer for NWIF. 

We look forward to seeing your application!
