U.S. IdolFes is a passion project founded by experienced event organizers. Our goal is to create an event space where idol fans of all types can gather and share in the unique joy that idols bring to our lives. Whether youâ€™re a long-time wota or just getting into the scene, USIF has a place for you!

Our staff app usually opens at the beginning of the year and then closes a week before USIF. This gives us time to onboard the latest applicants and then prepare for on-site activities. We then use the months after the event to reflect and determine staffing needs for the new year.

We require our staffers to provide one of the following:

* At least 12 hours of at-con volunteer activity, or
* Significant contribution to pre-con projects as determined by the staffer's supervisor.

In exchange, our staffers receive:

* A free badge allowing them to attend USIF for the full weekend,
* Access to our staff suite and hospitality areas with snacks, drinks, and rest space, and 
* Our undying gratitude!

The staff application is now LIVE! Please apply to staff [here](https://idolfe.st/staffapp)![](https://idolfe.st/staffapp)[](https://idolfe.st/staffapp)[](https://idolfe.st/staffapp)
