## Panelist & vendor applications are open!

### Panelists:

Are you a local idol who's ready for the spotlight? Want to share your niche area of idol fandom with the world? Northwest IdolFest is now accepting applications for panels, workshops, performances, and game shows. 

To apply, head over to our [application](https://idolfe.st/panelapp). We're excited to see your submissions!

Please note: this application is for those who are looking to host a panel or put on a performance of at least 30 minutes in length. This is NOT the application for our Northern Lights Music Festival.

### Vendors:

We're excited to host some wonderful community vendors at NWIF 2022! If you'd like to be considered, fill out our [application](https://idolfe.st/vendorapp) by July 1. From figures and original art prints to buttons and nesoberi, we want to bring the best idol merch to all of our fans!
