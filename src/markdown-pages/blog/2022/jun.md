## Lucia Hunter at NWIF 2022!

NWIF is excited to welcome Jun, aka Lucia Hunter, as an in-person guest at our 2022 event!

As an Events & Licensing Specialist for Bushiroad International, Jun is more commonly known for his role as Community Manager for the English versions of BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! & D4DJ Groovy Mix under the online alias Lucia Hunter. 

He's been around in the idol fandoms since the earlier days of Love Live! in 2013, and pioneered the Love Live! Wikia & associated Twitter account before subsequently moving onto BanG Dream!. Aside from work, his current interests lie in Arknights, Genshin Impact & roguelite games.
