Northwest IdolFest is looking for idols, DJs, and performers to join our Northern Lights concert! Northern Lights is our main stage concert event and will feature a variety of DJs and performers who share a passion for Japanese idol culture.

Last year, we were delighted to bring you a Saturday night concert packed full of idol and anisong music. This year, we're expanding to both Friday AND Saturday! That means more music, more wotagei, and more time for our amazing community to shine. 

Sound exciting? If you'd like to participate, please fill out [the application](https://idolfe.st/NL2022) by August 1st, 2022 @ 11:59 PM PT.
