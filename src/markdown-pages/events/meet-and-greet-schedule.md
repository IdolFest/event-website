W﻿e are excited to announce our meet and greet schedule for this year featuring our guests, our community performers, and our performers featured in Northern Lights Music Festival!

Vtuber meet and greets for Stellar Verse, VFleet Project, and other associated talents will be occurring courtesy of the organizations aforementioned.
