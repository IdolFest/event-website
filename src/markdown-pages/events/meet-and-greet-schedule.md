W﻿e are excited to announce our meet and greet schedule for this year featuring our guests, our community performers, and our performers featured in Northern Lights Music Festival!

Masks are not required in any areas this year; however, performers may request that those meeting them wear a mask. If requested, attendees are expected to comply. A limited quantity of masks will be available at the event, but we ask attendees bring their own if possible.

﻿﻿Whether the meet and greet is a paid or free meet and greet is at the discretion of each performer.
