Come join us at our rhythm game arcade on the 2nd floor, where we've got 6 different games to play, all full of our favorite idol, anime, Vocaloid, and game-related songs! 

We've also got some extra space for those who want to bring their own handheld games or just chill in a music-filled social space during your down-time! 

We'll be open 'til Midnight on Friday and Saturday this year for you night owls who want something to do at night!
