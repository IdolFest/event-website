Calling all musicians! We're hosting the third annual U.S. IdolFes Grand Prix Song Contest to showcase your original idol-themed compositions, covers and remixes!

## Fan Vote and Playlist

The fan vote will not open until October 1. Please check back then!

## Application

Applications have not yet opened for 2025. Please review the guidelines below and keep an eye on our social media [here](https://idolfes.us/contact/) for when applications open!

## General Guidelines

* **This year, we have a specific theme for this contest!** As our event is moving to a new location, the theme has a similar vibe: **New Horizons!** The song you create should embody the feelings and emotions of taking the next step, opening a new chapter, creating a new future - turning the zero into a one and a one into something even greater!
* Entries must include a melody and lyrics. This year will not include a category for instrumental or acapella entries.
* Entrant(s) do not have to be attending USIF to enter. 
* With the exception of judges, all USIF staff are also permitted to enter.
* One entry per person or group. All people working on an entry must be credited with their role in the entry if working as a group.
* **All individuals who have worked on an entry must have given their consent for the song to be entered in the contest, understand they can only be credited for one entry, and that they will only be eligible for one award.**

## Song Guidelines

* Songs must be between 1:30 and 5:00 long and can be in any language! They do not need to be able to be performed live.
* Please keep song content "PG-13" and refrain from any kind of triggering, inappropriate, or offensive content.
* Any content released prior to the time the contest was announced (May 30, 2025) will not be allowed. We also ask that submissions for this event are made specifically for this event.
* Original song submissions must be an entirely original work, or will be judged as a remix/cover.
* Remixes/covers must credit the original work in the entry form.
* The entrant(s) retain 100% of any rights and ownership of submitted songs. By submitting a song to this contest, entrant(s) permit USIF to use their song for purposes related to this year’s contest. This may include posting the song on social media or playing it at the event.
* The entrant(s) may also choose to grant permission to USIF to use their song in the future, with full credit.

## Submission Guidelines

* Entrant(s) must submit their work at https://idolfe.st/grandprixapp.
* Entrant(s) must upload their song to YouTube, with “This work is a submission for the 2025 U.S. IdolFes Grand Prix Song Contest” included in the description.
* E﻿ntrant(s) must also post their entry on at least one social media with the hashtag #USIFGrandPrix2025, and include this post in the entry form. This will allow your work to be a part of the fan voting process.
* Entry deadline is September 28, 2024 at 11:59pm PT.

## Judging:

* There are 3 categories available for judging:

  * Staff Pick: Original Song
  * Staff Pick: Original Cover/Remix
  * Fan Favorite
* Entries should be reflective of the styles of music found in Japanese idol culture. We are looking for works that fall under a J-pop-like genre, and capture the spirit of idols shining brightly on a stage. We hope to see entries that we can point to as an example of idols as a whole!
* Entries will be judged by the song alone. A choreographed music video, animation, or dance is not necessary for entries to be accepted, and will not factor into judging.
* Staff Pick awards will be determined by a panel of USIF staff and guest judges. All entrants will receive notes and feedback from our judges which will be released after the award winners have been announced.
* The Fan Favorite award will be determined by a vote of the public.
* There will be a YouTube playlist available of all entries so that everyone can listen and support the submissions.
* The Fan Favorite vote will be opened October 1st, 2025 and will be open until October 31st, 2025 at 6:59pm PT. 
* The winners will be announced during U.S. IdolFes 2025, and announced to all people not in attendance at some point after Closing Ceremonies!
