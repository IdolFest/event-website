Calling all musicians! The Northwest IdolFest Grand Prix Song Contest is returning for its second year! Once again, it is time to showcase your original 
idol-themed songs alongside your idol-themed covers and remixes!

Have you read the guidelines below and seen the cool cash and prizes in store this year? Is your song ready to go? Head on over to 
https://idolfe.st/grandprixapp to apply and submit your song!

## General Guidelines

* The general theme for this song contest is the same as our convention: idols! Please reflect the spirit of Japanese idols in your music in some way. Any style and genre of music with or without vocals will be accepted so long as it follows this theme in some way.
* Entrant(s) do not have to be attending NWIF to enter. 
* With the exception of judges, all NWIF staff are also permitted to enter.
* One entry per person or group. All people working on an entry must be credited with their role in the entry if working as a group.
* For the original song category, a person must only participate in creating one song in the composer/arranger/producer role. Otherwise, for other roles and in all other categories entrants may participate in up to three (3) entries.

## Song Guidelines
* Songs must be between 1:30 and 5:00 long and can be in any language! They do not need to be able to be performed live.
* Please keep song content "PG-13" and refrain from any kind of triggering, inappropriate, or offensive content.
* Any content released prior to the time the contest was announced (May 12, 2023) will not be allowed.
* Original song submissions must be an entirely original work, or will be judged as a remix/cover.
* Remixes/covers must credit the original work in the entry form.
* The entrant(s) retain 100% of any rights and ownership of submitted songs. By submitting a song to this contest, entrant(s) permit NWIF to use their song for purposes related to this yearâ€™s contest. This may include posting the song on social media or playing it at the event.
* The entrant(s) may also choose to grant permission to NWIF to use their song in the future, with full credit.

## Submission Guidelines
* Entrant(s) must submit their work at https://idolfe.st/grandprixapp.
* Entrants must upload their song to YouTube. If you do not have a video for your song, you can use an online converter to convert your audio file to a video file with an image of your choice, which can then be uploaded to YouTube.
* Entrant(s) are encouraged (but not required) to also upload their song to their own social media or platforms with the hashtag #NWIFGrandPrix. Northwest Idolfest may reupload your entry on your behalf with credit for the purpose of fan voting if you are not able to share an accessible link to your entry.
* Entry deadline is September 29, 2023 at 11:59p PT.

## Judging:
* There are 4 categories available for judging:
  * Staff Pick: Original Song
  * Staff Pick: Original Cover/Remix
  * Staff Pick: Emerging Composer
  * Fan Favorite
* Entries will be judged by the song alone. A music video, animation, or dance is not necessary for entries to be accepted.
* Staff Pick awards will be determined by a vote of NWIF staff alongside Feris, our guest judge and experienced idol composer! All judges will provide feedback that will be distributed to entrants after winners have been announced.
* The Fan Favorite award will be determined by a vote of the public.
* The Fan Favorite vote will be opened October 1st, and will remain open until October 20th at 11:59p PT.
